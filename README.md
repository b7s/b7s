### Hey <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"> I'm Bruno

A Technology Enthusiast. If something’s broken, messy, or just plain annoying, I’m probably already building a smarter way to fix it. I focused on Laravel, some times with Go, to craft solid APIs, scalable systems, and tools that make life easier for devs and users alike. When I’m not deep in backend logic, I’m exploring peer-to-peer networks, automation scripts, and distributed architectures.

Here’s what I enjoy doing:

🔧 Building custom solutions with Laravel that actually solve real problems.

🤖 Automating boring stuff so we can focus on what matters.

🌐 Playing with decentralized networks and P2P protocols (with Go Lang).

🧪 Experimenting with ideas until they turn into something useful.

🛠️ Creating CLI tools, Docker setups, and modular configs that just work.

📌 Philosophy: If the perfect solution doesn’t exist yet… I’ll build it.
